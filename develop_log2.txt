Current issue is usr program can not key-in character from console. 
Same as guess, the console input wait on a queue that hangs on a lock.
This lock is waked from UART interrupt. Interrupt handle also send char
into the input queue.


Trace code of interrupt emulate on qemu
---------------------------------------
vexpress.c initilize a GIC 
    /* 0x2c000000 A15MPCore private memory region (GIC) */
    init_cpus(cpu_model, "a15mpcore_priv", 0x2c000000, pic);
then found the TYPE_A15MPCORE_PRIV in a15mpcore.c:


    /* The Cortex-A15MP may have anything from 0 to 224 external interrupt
     * IRQ lines (with another 32 internal). We default to 128+32, which
     * is the number provided by the Cortex-A15MP test chip in the
     * Versatile Express A15 development board.
     * Other boards may differ and should set this property appropriately.
